# Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) README

Welcome to the **Approximate Nearest Neighbours** repository! This project explores techniques and algorithms for efficiently finding approximate nearest neighbors in large datasets, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a crucial technique in machine learning, information retrieval, computer vision, and many other domains where fast similarity searches are required .

## üìù Description

This Jupyter Notebook (`Approximate_nearest_neighbours.ipynb`) provides an introduction and hands-on implementation of Approximate Nearest Neighbor search methods. The notebook includes:

- An overview of what Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) are.
- Practical implementations of ANN algorithms using libraries such as **Annoy** .
- Performance comparisons and visualizations to help understand how these algorithms work in real-world scenarios.

The goal of this notebook is to serve as both an educational resource and a practical guide for implementing ANN-based solutions.

## üîç Key Concepts Covered

- **Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS)**: The optimization problem of finding the point in a given dataset that is closest (or most similar) to a query point .
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)**: A method that trades off accuracy for speed and efficiency, allowing faster searches in large or high-dimensional datasets .
- **Applications**: Image retrieval, recommendation systems, clustering, classification, facial recognition , and outlier detection .
- **Algorithms Explored**:
  - Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)
